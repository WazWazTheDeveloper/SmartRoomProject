## Prometheus

## EMQX's Prometheus scraping endpoint is enabled by default without authentication.
## And there is no way to turn it off.
## You can inspect it with a curl command: curl -f "127.0.0.1:18083/api/v5/prometheus/stats"

prometheus {
    # turn off this expensive collector
    vm_dist_collector = disabled
}
