    ## Generated an alarm when an Erlang process spends a long time to perform garbage collection
    ## Type:
    ##   - disabled :: Never alarm
    ##   - Time During :: The maximum GC time for generating an alarm
    long_gc = 100ms

    ## Generating an alarm is generated when the Erlang VM detect a task scheduled for too long
    ## Type:
    ##   - disabled :: Never alarm
    ##   - Duration:: The maximum schedule time for generating an alarm
    long_schedule = 240ms

    ## Generating an alarm when an Erlang process consumed a large amount of memory for its heap space
    ## Type:
    ##   - disabled :: Never alarm
    ##   - ByteSize :: The maximum heap size for generating an alarm
    large_heap = 32MB

    ## Generating an alarm when the RPC connection is overloaded
    busy_dist_port = true

    ## Generating an alarm when a port (e.g. TCP socket) is overloaded
    busy_port = true
